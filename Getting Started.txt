To set up development environment:
*Following this tutorial: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/nodejs-devenv.html

1. Install Node.js from nodejs.org
2. Install npm from npmjs.com
3. Install aws-sdk in terminal
	"npm install aws-sdk"
4. Install express in terminal
	"npm install -g express"
5. Add express to your PATH variable if needed

To run the app locally
1. Install dependencies with npm. Node Package Manager will install any necessary packages.
	"npm install"
2. Start server
	"npm start"
3. Navigate to "http://localhost:3000" on your browser.

NOTE: Lock down dependency versions with "npm shrinkwrap" (Only do if deploying into production).
NOTE: "npm start" is also the command AWS Elasticbeanstalk runs to start the server.
